## Installation

After cloning this repository from Github, use the terminal to cd into the folder, then run `npm install`.

After that, run `npm start` and keep your terminal window open and running while using the application locally.

## Development info

To-do lists are a tried and tested way to introduce learners to **React state management** and demonstrate the power and usefulness of **React single-page applications**. This one started out as such a lesson when React was first covered in Wild Code School's bootcamp. Initially a very simple application with almost no styling and only the ability to add new paragraphs of user input to a list, the lesson impressed me and sparked my curiosity.

I decided to recreate the code from the lesson to deepen my understanding, then added a landing "page", which in reality is just a **component conditionally displayed based on state**. To challenge myself even further, I extended the core functionality of the app, adding a **list of categories** which the user can choose from and assign one of them as a label for each of their tasks. From here the next step was to add a state based **filter option**, allowing the user to display only tasks of a specific category.

All of this proved to be a very valuable lesson in React state management, handling multiple different state updates at the same time and making sure all components render correctly, as well as in applying the **Javascript methods filter, findIndex and slice**. Lastly I worked on a **responsive, distinct UI design** with CSS that fits the theme of to-do notes and references Wild Code School in name and theme color.
